Brevet time calculator with MongoDB!

Description: 
You'll add a storage to your previous project using MongoDB and `docker-compose`.
As we discussed, `docker-compose` makes it easier to create, manage and connect multiple container to create a single service comprised of different sub-services.

Presently, there's only a placeholder directory for your Flask app, and a `docker-compose` configuration file. You will copy over `brevets/` from your completed project 4, add a MongoDB service to docker-compose and your Flask app. You will also add two buttons named `Submit` and `Display` to the webpage. `Submit` must store the information (brevet distance, start time, checkpoints and their opening and closing times) in the database (overwriting existing ones). `Display` will fetch the information from the database and fill in the form with them.

From Project 4: 
You'll lean how to write test cases and test your corde, along with more JQuery. You will reimplement RUSA ACP controls time calculator with Flask and AJAX.
